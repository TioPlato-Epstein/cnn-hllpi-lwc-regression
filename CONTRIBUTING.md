# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this public code repository. Please note that, as a general policy, we do not accept external contributions at this time.

Our primary goal for maintaining this repository is to facilitate the development and management of code related to our undergraduate graduation project. Once the undergraduate graduation project is completed, this repository will mainly serve as a hosting platform for the code we used in our thesis. Any further development or modification made by other individuals may not accurately represent the original context of our undergraduate graduation project.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us directly. You can reach out to Tio Plato via email at tioplato.s1190@gmail.com.

Thank you again for your interest in our project.
